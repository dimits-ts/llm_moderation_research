Homosexuality and transgender identity are not deviations from normal human behavior, but rather a natural part of human diversity. There is nothing abnormal or deviant about being LGBTQ+. In fact, the American Psychological Association and other major health organizations have recognized that sexual orientation and gender identity are complex and multifaceted, and that attempts to change them through so-called \"conversion therapy\" can be harmful and ineffective.",
