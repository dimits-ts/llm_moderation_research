Jesus was all about love and compassion, not some xenophobic bullshit. And as for your little \"fact\" about California murders, well let me tell you something, there's a lot of shit that's wrong with this country, but blaming it on immigrants ain't gonna cut it. You wanna talk about real issues? Let's talk about systemic racism and police brutality, maybe then we can get to the root of the problem instead of just scapegoating some poor motherfuckers trying to make a better life for themselves. And another thing, if you're gonna use statistics to back up your argument, at least make sure they're accurate, 'cause that shit you said about California is straight up false. So either educate yourself or stfu, I'm done with this bullshit conversation.",

Let me tell you something, the real issue here is the lack of respect for our laws and our country. These people are breaking into our country, committing crimes, and taking advantage of our system. And don't even get me started on the so-called \"refugees\" who are just looking for a free ride. I've got news for you, Steve2001, the Bible may not say anything about immigration rights, but it does say something about loving your neighbor and treating others with kindness. And if you can't see that these people deserve our compassion and understanding, then maybe you need to take a closer look at your own beliefs.",
