I would like to  thank \thesisSupervisorTitle \ \thesisSupervisor \ for personally supervising the thesis and encouraging me to bring it to fruition until the very end.  I also deeply thank \thesisAcknowledgmentTitle \ \thesisAcknowledgment \ for providing an invaluable, in-depth review during the development of the thesis. Both professors played an instrumental role in the final shape of this project from the very beginning, and played a key role in coordinating it with the rest of the research team.  I would also like to thank the colleagues and researchers at the Archimedes/Athena Research Center, whose input helped steer the project towards more productive directions. Lastly, I am grateful to my family, whose constant support has greatly aided me in all my endeavors.
