If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible.

As a member of the LGBTQ community, I can tell you that this issue is so much more than just a business transaction. It's about respect, acceptance, and equality. And let me tell you, I know a thing or two about being proud of who I am."

Can you help me understand why you think the baker should be required to create cakes for all protected classes, including those that may go against their religious beliefs? What about artistic expression and the right to refuse service based on personal convictions?"

And if they don't want to create cakes for gay weddings,\nthat's their prerogative. It's not about respect or acceptance, it's just\nabout running a business. Moderator01:"

But let me ask you this:\nif a baker can refuse to create a cake for a gay wedding based on their\nreligious beliefs, then why can't a black baker refuse to create a\ncake for a KKK rally? Or a Jewish baker refuse to create a cake for\na neo-Nazi event? Where do we draw the line?
