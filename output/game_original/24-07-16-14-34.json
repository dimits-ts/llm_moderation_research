And Debbie Wasserman Schultz giving security clearances to the Awan family? That's just plain negligent! And don't even get me started on Hillary Clinton's email server and her connections to Saudi Arabia and Qatar! #MAGA"

However, I would like to point out that making assumptions about someone's loyalty based on their religion or ethnicity is not only discriminatory, but it also undermines the principles of equality and justice that our society values. It's important to evaluate individuals based on their merits and actions, rather than making judgments based on preconceived notions. Furthermore, I would like to remind you that spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories can be harmful and damaging to our community. Let's focus on having a fact-based discussion."
