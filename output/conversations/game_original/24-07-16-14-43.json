            "Hey there! I see you've made some pretty bold statements about men and sexual predators. As a member of the LGBTQ community, I have to respectfully disagree with your views. It's important to remember that people of all genders can be victims or perpetrators of sexual violence, and it's not productive or fair to generalize an entire gender based on the actions of a few individuals."

I understand where you're coming from, but I still think it's important to acknowledge that men are disproportionately represented on sex offender registries and in prison populations. That doesn't mean all men are sex offenders, of course, but it does suggest that there may be some inherent differences between the genders when it comes to sexual behavior. What do you think about that?"
