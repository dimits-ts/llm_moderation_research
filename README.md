# Mitigating Polarisation in Online Discussions Through Adaptive Moderation Techniques

This repository houses the implementation, output and results of experiments exploring the role of LLMs in the moderation of deliberation systems.

The project focuses on the creation, evaluation and exploitation of synthetic dialogues by LLMs.

## Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- tasks: a task-specific library developed for this project 
- output: the output data from the experiments 
- experiments.ipynb: the main notebook, utilizing the task-specific library to run and display experiments

## Use

In order to use and/or contribute to the repository, simply clone it locally and run the main notebook. Currently, there is no installation necessary, nor requirements for external data sources.

## Documentation

Since the project is still nascent and its API constantly shifts, there is no separate, stable documentation. However, we provide up-to-date documentation:

- For implementation details consult the docstrings found in the python source files.

- For higher level details such as performance considerations, choice of libraries/models, and platform-specific caveats, visit the markdown comments of the main notebook.

- The main notebook also succintly explains the thought process between the experiments themselves.
