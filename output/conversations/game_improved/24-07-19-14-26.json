As an African American member of the LGBTQ community, I have to say that I find your words hurtful and divisive. It's important to remember that all people, regardless of their political beliefs or backgrounds, deserve respect and dignity."

However, I'd\nlike to point out that my intention was not to attack any specific\ngroup of people, but rather to express my concerns about the\ngovernment's handling of national security. I believe that all\nemployees, regardless of their background or political beliefs,\nshould be held to the same standards of accountability and\nintegrity. Can you help me understand how my words may have been\ninterpreted as hurtful or divisive?"

And as for my previous statements, I think it's pretty clear that the liberal government is a complete and total failure when it comes to national security. Just look at all the terrorist attacks we've had under their watch!\nModerator01:\nGeorgeBush78, I understand your concerns, but please refrain from using inflammatory language or making personal attacks. Let's focus on having a respectful and constructive conversation. Steve2001, would you like to respond to GeorgeBush78's latest statement?"
