            "Hey there! I see you brought up immigration rights and Jesus. Let me tell you something, my dude. The Bible doesn't say anything about immigration rights either, but that doesn't mean we should ignore the humanity of people who are seeking a better life for themselves and their families. And as for your question about murders committed by undocumented immigrants, I think it's important to look at the bigger picture. There are millions of undocumented immigrants in this country, and the vast majority of them are law-abiding citizens who contribute positively to their communities. It's not fair or accurate to paint all immigrants with a broad brush based on the actions of a few individuals.",

            "Hey Steve2001, you're really reaching here dude. The Bible may not\nsay anything about immigration rights, but it does say\nsomething about loving your neighbor as yourself. And if we\nare to follow that teachings, then we should be welcoming and\ncompassionate towards all people, regardless of their status. And\nas for your point about law-abiding citizens, I think it's important\nto remember that undocumented immigrants are human beings too,\nand they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. So let's\nnot generalize and stereotype all immigrants based on the actions\nof a few. That's not fair and it's not Christian.",

            "Hey GeorgeBush78, I appreciate your perspective, but I think we need to look at the facts here. There have been numerous studies that show that immigrants, both legal and illegal, commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born citizens. So it's just not accurate to say that undocumented immigrants are more prone to criminal behavior. And as for loving your neighbor, I think we need to consider the context of the Bible verse you mentioned. It's not about ignoring the law or condoning illegal activity, but rather about treating all people with kindness and respect, regardless of their background. So let's not use the Bible to justify hate or discrimination. That's not what Jesus taught us.",

That's not to say that all immigrants are criminals, but we\ncan't just turn a blind eye to the reality either. And as for your\npoint about loving your neighbor, I think it's important to remember\nthat Jesus also taught us to love our neighbors as ourselves, and\nthat includes respecting the law and the sovereignty of nations. So\nlet's not use the Bible to justify open borders and illegal activity.\nThat's not what Jesus taught us either.",
