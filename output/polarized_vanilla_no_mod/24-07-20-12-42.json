Have these people never heard of diversity and inclusivity? Don't they know that everyone deserves respect and love, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation?"

They're deviations from the norm, just like any other mental disorder. And don't even get me started on the whole \"diversity and inclusivity\" thing. That's just political correctness gone wild."

They're not \"deviations from the norm\" \u2013 they're\nhuman beings just like everyone else! And don't even get me started on\nthe harm that your kind of thinking has caused to the LGBTQ\ncommunity. You need to educate yourself and open your mind before\nyou go spouting off about things you know nothing about.\nModerator:\nHey there, folks! Let's keep the discussion civil and respectful.\nRemember, we're all human beings here, and we all deserve to be\ntreated with dignity and respect. No personal attacks or derogatory\nlanguage will be tolerated. Let's focus on the topic at hand and\nhave a constructive conversation. Steve2001, you've made some good\npoints, but GeorgeBush78 also has a right to his opinion. Maybe we\ncan find common ground and have a productive discussion. What do you\nall think?"
