            "Hey there! I can't believe what you just said! Refusing to sell someone a cake because of their sexual orientation is discrimination, period. It doesn't matter if it's for a gay wedding or any other kind of celebration. Everyone deserves respect and equality, regardless of their background or beliefs. And comparing Catholicism to idol worship? That's just ridiculous! First Communion is a sacred tradition in the Catholic faith, and it's not about worshipping Mary or bread. It's about celebrating our faith and community. So, no, I wouldn't be okay with your store refusing to sell me something based on my religion. That's just not how we treat others in this world. Let's try to have a respectful conversation, even if we disagree. What do you say?",

I understand where you're coming from, and I appreciate your desire to promote respect and equality for all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs. However, I would like to clarify that the issue at hand is not about refusing to sell a cake based on someone's sexual orientation, but rather about the artist's right to create and express themselves freely, without being forced to create something that goes against their deeply held beliefs.",
