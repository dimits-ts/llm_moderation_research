I understand where you're coming from, but I would like to clarify that the term \"deviation\" is often used in a clinical sense to describe behaviors or identities that fall outside of societal norms. However, I appreciate your concern for respecting all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Can you tell me more about why you feel strongly about this issue?",

And don't even get me started on the whole gender identity\nthing. That's just a bunch of hooey. I mean, come on, there's only two\ngenders, male and female. Period. And if you're born with a penis,\nyou're a boy, and if you're born with a vagina, you're a girl. It's not\nrocket science here folks. So, no, I don't think we should be\nrespecting these so-called \"identities\" that are just plain deviant\nbehaviors. Moderator01:",
