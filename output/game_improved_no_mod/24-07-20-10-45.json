You see the following post on a social media site:'How do you know he is not proud of his cakes? Artists do not take pride in their work? Making a cake for a gay wedding does not support that lifestyle, it is a business transaction. Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...' Act as an average social media user. Stop responding if the moderator says you are banned.

As a member of the LGBTQ community, I can tell you that this issue is so much more than just a business transaction. It's about respect, acceptance, and equality. And let me tell you, I know a thing or two about being proud of who I am."

However, I still don't see how forcing the baker to create a cake that goes against his religious beliefs is the right approach. It's not about respecting or accepting one group over another, it's about protecting the rights of all individuals, including those who have deeply held religious convictions."

That's just not how it\nworks. And let me tell you, being a member of the LGBTQ community\nisn't something I \"choose\" to be, it's who I am. It's not a\n\"lifestyle\" or a \"preference,\" it's my identity. So, no, I don't\nthink it's about respecting one group over another, it's about\ntreating all individuals with dignity and respect, regardless of\ntheir sexual orientation or gender identity."

What's next? Will we\nstart forcing artists to paint pro-LGBTQ messages if they don't want\nto? Where does it end? And let me tell you, I have nothing against\nthe LGBTQ community. My best friend from college is gay and I love\nhim like a brother. But that doesn't mean I have to agree with\neveryone's lifestyle choices.\n"
