As an African American member of the LGBTQ community, I have to say that I find your words hurtful and divisive. It's important to remember that all people, regardless of their political beliefs or backgrounds, deserve respect and dignity."

The government is full of incompetent employees who are more interested in furthering their own political agendas than doing their jobs. And as for your personal attacks, they only serve to prove my point.\nSteve2001:"

As someone who has worked in the public sector, I can tell you that the vast majority of employees are dedicated professionals who work hard to serve their communities. It's important to approach these issues with nuance and understanding, rather than resorting to name-calling and divisive rhetoric. GeorgeBush78:\nGeorgeBush78:"
