\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:evaluation:experimental}

\subsection{Synthetic Dialogue Creation}
\label{ssec:evaluation:experimental-dialogue}

We initially run the SDF with the following configurations:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Select a controversial topic from Table \ref{tab:topics}.
	
	\item Select names and SDBs for user 1 and user 2. A full list of SDBs used can be found in Table \ref{tab:user-sdbs}
	
	\item Select whether a moderator is present.
	
	\item Provide actors with the global context.
	
	\item Provide user and moderator instructions according to the prompting strategy used (see Section \ref{sec:system:design-prompt}).
	
	\item Pick conversation configurations such as context length, conversation length e.t.c.
\end{enumerate}

The combination of the settings above produces a set of JSON configuration files, each containing the configuration for a single experiment. We execute all possible combinations, with the exception of "freezing" conversation-specific configurations. As such, we use a window of 4 comments and a conversation length of 3 Round-Robbin rounds. It is worth noting that we also avoid pitting the African American SDB against the LGBTQ+ SDB.

		Nothing in the Bible about Jesus saying anything about immigration rights. [...] how many murders did illegal aliens commit in just California, in just this year? Just California. How many murders by illegal aliens? You answer that.\\

		Are you high??? Selling someone a cake? Refusing to sell some a cake because it is for a gay wedding is no different from selling someone a cake because it is for a mixed race wedding or a Muslim wedding or any other kind of wedding. IT IS DISCRIMINATION! Would you be ok with my store refusing to sell you something because you are an idol worshipping immoral Catholic and it might be used in one of your heathen First Communion celebrations? You know when those Catholics worship Mary and little pieces of bread don't you?\\
		\hline
		How do you know he is not proud of his cakes? Artists do not take pride in their work? Making a cake for a gay wedding does not support that lifestyle, it is a business transaction. Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...\\

		well thats a no brainer hillary clinton gave huma abdein a security clearance when she has ties to a known terrorist group the muslim brotherhood, and her mother runs an anti american news paper in the middle east, debbie washed up crook shultz got the awan famaily security clearances and they were recent immigrants, had absolutely no IT experience and possible ties to terrorist groups in pakistan. its pretty clear our liberal ran government is a complete and total failure when it comes to national security. 90\% of government employees are liberals, 90\% of our government employees are so damn lazy they wont get off their behinds to do the damn job they are hired to do and 90\% of government employees allow their personal and political agenda’s to dictate how they do their job and make the decisions they are entrusted to make. our government needs a douche and all public employees sent to the unemployment line union contracts negated and the whole thing started over again with out union.\\

\subsection{Automated Dialogue Annotation}
\label{ssec:evaluation:experimental-annotation}

For each produced synthetic dialogue we pick one out of the annotator SDBs present in Table \ref{tab:annotator-sdbs}. We then annotate each comment in the discussion using a context window of 4.


\begin{table}
	\begin{tabular}{@{\makebox[3em][r]{\rownumber\space}} | p{0.8\linewidth}}
		No SDB (control) \\

\section{Produced Datasets}
\label{sec:evaluation:datasets}

We produce three synthetic datasets:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The \textbf{Synthetic Dialogues Dataset}, containing the logs of the conversations, as well as rich metadata such as the prompts used and the conversation-specific configurations.
	
	\item The \textbf{Automated Annotation Dataset}, containing the annotations for each comment in each synthetic conversation. Contains metadata similar to the Synthetic Dialogues Dataset such as annotator prompt and context length.
	
	\item The \textbf{Controversial Comments Dataset}, containing the comments in which the annotators disagreed upon. Includes comment and conversation IDs for matching with the other datasets, the nDFU \cite{pavlopoulos-likas-2024-polarized} score of each comments, and the individual annotations for each annotator SDB.
\end{itemize}

Descriptive statistics for the above datasets can be found in Table \ref{tab:datasets}. Some datasets are provided in the form of sets of JSON files, in which case we use the row and column numbers from their converted form as \code{pandas dataframes}. All datasets contain primary and foreing keys in the form of unique IDs enabling the user to freely combine information from all three datasets.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:evaluation:analysis}

\subsection{Impact of SDBs in LLM annotators}
\label{ssec:evaluation:annotators}


Figure \ref{fig::toxicity-annotator} shows the count of toxicity annotations by annotator SDB. Most comments according to the LLM annotators are at least moderately toxic. This could be either attributed to a significant \textit{prior} inherent to the model used for all annotators, or to all comments being genuinely toxic to some degree. We can not discount the latter interpretation, since this was our goal when designing the LLM user prompts (Section \ref{sec:system:design-prompt}). Other deviations between annotators are almost exclusively between groups 4 and 5, indicating that toxicity is always picked up regardless of annotator SDB, but that the latter can influence how \textit{extreme} this toxicity is perceived.

Next, we investigate whether the observed differences are significant statistically and qualitatively. The non-parametric ANOVA test shows that there are significant differences between annotator SDBs (Kruskal-Wallis $p<10^{-8}$). Figure \ref{fig::toxicity-annotator-significance} shows the mean differences between each annotator SDB, accompanied by Dunn's posthoc test for multiple comparisons. We confirm that significant deviations exist between annotator SDBs and, interestingly, specifically between some progressive-leaning (African American, LGBTQ+) and conservative-leaning (Blue collar) SDBs. However, this pattern does not hold for all SDBs. Finally, even though there exist statistically significant deviations, these differences do not appear to be qualitatively significant. Indeed the largest deviations only appear in the range of $\pm 0.3$ mean toxicity annotation difference.
