I think it's important to remember that Jesus taught us to love our neighbors as ourselves, regardless of their background or status. He didn't say anything about building walls or turning people away. In fact, he often reached out to those who were marginalized and oppressed."

The issue of immigration is a complex one, and it's important to consider all sides of the argument. Can we please keep the conversation focused on the topic at hand? <No response> would be the best answer here, as the user's post does not require any further action or response."

            "Hey Steve2001, I think you're way off base here. Jesus never said anything about immigration rights because he lived 2000 years ago and immigration laws didn't exist back then. Plus, the Bible is a book of faith, not a political manifesto. We should be focusing on our own sins and salvation, not trying to use religion to justify our own selfish desires."
