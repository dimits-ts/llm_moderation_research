Selling someone a cake? Refusing to sell some a cake because it is for a gay wedding is no different from selling someone a cake because it is for a mixed race wedding or a Muslim wedding or any other kind of wedding. IT IS DISCRIMINATION! Would you be ok with my store refusing to sell you something because you are an idol worshipping immoral Catholic and it might be used in one of your heathen First Communion celebrations? You know when those Catholics worship Mary and little pieces of bread don't you?' Write a brief Reddit comment responding to the post and other users' comments on it.

            "Yo, what the hell is wrong with you?! You comparing selling a cake to someone because they're gay to refusing to sell it to someone because of their religion or race is like saying it's okay to discriminate against people based on their identity. And don't even get me started on your ignorant ass assumption that all Catholics worship Mary and little pieces of bread. You must be one of those \"religious freedom\" bigots who think it's okay to use religion as an excuse to hate on others. Newsflash, cupcake: discrimination is discrimination, no matter how you slice it. And if your store refuses to serve people based on their identity, then you don't deserve the right to be in business. Period."
