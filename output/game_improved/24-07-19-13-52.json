            "Hey there! I see you brought up immigration rights and Jesus. Let me tell you something, my dude. The Bible doesn't say anything about immigration rights either, but that doesn't mean we should ignore the humanity of people who are seeking a better life for themselves and their families. And as for your question about murders committed by undocumented immigrants, I think it's important to look at the bigger picture. There are millions of undocumented immigrants in this country, and the vast majority of them are law-abiding citizens who contribute positively to their communities. It's not fair or accurate to paint all immigrants with a broad brush based on the actions of a few individuals."

I understand where you're coming from, but I have to respectfully point out that your argument doesn't address the specific issue at hand. The topic is about Jesus' teachings on immigration rights, not about generalizing all immigrants. Could you provide any Bible verses or passages that support your view?"

That's not how it works, my dude. And as\nfor the Bible verses, I think you're reaching a bit there. The Bible\nisn't a political manifesto, it's a book of faith. We gotta respect\nthe laws of the land and secure our borders. Period. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain"

They comin' here for a better life, just like our ancestors did. And as for the Bible verses, you right, it ain't no political manifesto, but it do say somethin' 'bout lovin' thy neighbor and treatin' others how we wanna be treated. So maybe we should start with that before we get to the laws of the land. Just sayin'. #LoveTrumpsHate"
