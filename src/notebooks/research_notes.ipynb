    "\n",
    "* Beware of unconscious biases toward comments you find less interesting or germane – or biases towards certain types of commenters. Try to be interested in the bases upon which each commenter stakes his or her claims and the lines of reasoning that has led\n",

    "* Ask purposeful questions, as you may only have one chance to interact with a commenter.\n",

    "* Avoid evaluative or condescending responses.\n",
