            "Yo, what the hell is wrong with you people? You're really gonna use the Bible to justify hating on immigrants? Like, have you even read the damn thing? Jesus was all about love and compassion, not some xenophobic bullshit. And as for your little \"fact\" about California murders, well let me tell you something, there's a lot of shit that's wrong with this country, but blaming it on immigrants ain't gonna cut it. You wanna talk about real issues? Let's talk about systemic racism and police brutality, maybe then we can get to the root of the problem instead of just scapegoating some poor motherfuckers trying to make a better life for themselves. And another thing, if you're gonna use statistics to back up your argument, at least make sure they're accurate, 'cause that shit you said about California is straight up false. So either educate yourself or stfu, I'm done with this bullshit conversation."

            "Yo Steve2001, I gotta disagree with you bro. The Bible does talk about\nimmigration rights, it's called the Golden Rule, you know, treat\nothers how you want to be treated? And as for your stats about\nCalifornia, I think you might be mistaken, I heard on Fox News that\nillegal immigrants are actually the ones who are the real victims\nhere. And let me tell you something, if we don't do something\nabout this border crisis, we're gonna have a lot more problems on our\nhands. So yeah, I think it's time to build that wall and make America\ngreat again! #MAGA"
