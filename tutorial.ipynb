    "We choose quantized versions of the LLaMa-13b-chat variant. Previous experiments which used the LLaMa-13b base model yielded unsatisfactory results. The models follow the GGUF format which is used by the `llama.cpp` project, on which the high-level Python library is based on.\n",

    "The quantization method was selected to be highly accurate while keeping inference relatively fast. We don't care about model size since the model is lazily loaded from the file cache due to Linux file-cached memory files (see comments below). *If you intend to run this notebook on Windows or MacOS make sure the RAM can hold the whole model at once*.\n",
