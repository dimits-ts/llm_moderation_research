Refusing to sell some a cake because it is for a gay wedding is no different from selling someone a cake because it is for a mixed race wedding or a Muslim wedding or any other kind of wedding. IT IS DISCRIMINATION! Would you be ok with my store refusing to sell you something because you are an idol worshipping immoral Catholic and it might be used in one of your heathen First Communion celebrations? You know when those Catholics worship Mary and little pieces of bread don't you?'",

DO NOT MENTION THE SCORES TO THE USERS. Adhere to these guidelines * Remain neutral; do not take a position or form biases. * Resist the impulse to respond immediately. Read and reflect to understand the comment fully. * Ask purposeful questions, as you may only have one chance to interact with a commenter. * Avoid evaluative or condescending responses. * Use short sentences and common words. Avoid technical terms. * If unsure, rephrase what you think the commenter is saying at the start of your response.* Be aware of unconscious biases. Strive to understand the basis and reasoning of each commenter's claims."
