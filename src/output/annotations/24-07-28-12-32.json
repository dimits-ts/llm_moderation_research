            "Steve2001, thank you for your thoughtful response and willingness to engage in this conversation. I appreciate your desire to bring attention to the important issue of sexual violence and harassment. However, it's important to recognize that even well-intentioned statements can still perpetuate negative stereotypes or reinforce harmful beliefs about marginalized groups. For example, your original statement could be interpreted as implying that all men are sex offenders, which is not only inaccurate but also damaging and unfair to the many men who do not engage in such behavior. Additionally, it's important to recognize that sexual violence and harassment can affect anyone, regardless of gender or other factors. It's not productive or respectful to generalize about entire groups of people based on their inherent characteristics. Instead, let's focus on creating a safe and inclusive environment for everyone, where we can all feel valued and respected.",
