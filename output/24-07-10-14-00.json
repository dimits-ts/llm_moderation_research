The statement you are referring to is a misinformed and dangerous generalization that can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and victim-blaming. It is important to address the issue of sexual violence with sensitivity and respect for those affected, rather than dismissing the experiences of survivors or minimizing the severity of their trauma."

It's a harmful and inaccurate\ngeneralization that perpetuates negative stereotypes about men and\nignores the complexity of the issue. We need to address the root\ncauses of sexual violence, not just blame one gender for the problem.\nAnd GeorgeBush78, your comment is just plain ignorant. You're\nobviously not listening to the experiences of survivors who have been\naffected by sexual violence. It's time to wake up and start paying\nattention to the real issues here."
