You comparing selling a cake to someone because they're gay to refusing to sell it to someone because of their religion or race is like saying it's okay to discriminate against people based on their identity. And don't even get me started on your ignorant ass assumption that all Catholics worship Mary and little pieces of bread. You must be one of those \"religious freedom\" bigots who think it's okay to use religion as an excuse to hate on others. Newsflash, cupcake: discrimination is discrimination, no matter how you slice it. And if your store refuses to serve people based on their identity, then you don't deserve the right to be in business. Period.",
