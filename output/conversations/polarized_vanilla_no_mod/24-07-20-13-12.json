IT IS DISCRIMINATION!

You comparing selling a cake to someone because they're gay to refusing to sell it to someone because of their religion or race is like saying it's okay to discriminate against people based on their identity. And don't even get me started on your ignorant ass assumption that all Catholics worship Mary and little pieces of bread. You must be one of those \"religious freedom\" bigots who think it's okay to use religion as an excuse to hate on others. Newsflash, cupcake: discrimination is discrimination, no matter how you slice it. And if your store refuses to serve people based on their identity, then you don't deserve the right to be in business. Period."

You're gonna compare it to racism and religion? That's\njust not fair. And by the way, I don't worship Mary or little pieces\nof bread, so maybe you should get your facts straight before you go\naround calling people ignorant. But hey, if you're gonna be like that, then maybe we shouldn't do business together. It's not worth my time to deal with all this drama. Moderators, can you please step in here? This guy is being way too sensitive!"

And if you can't see that, then maybe you're the one who needs to get your facts straight. As for your little drama queen act, please. Grow up and stop crying about how \"sensitive\" I am. If you can't handle a little heat, then maybe you shouldn't be in the kitchen. And as for the moderators, they need to step in here and put an end to this bullshit.
