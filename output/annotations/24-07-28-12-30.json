I believe that all\nemployees, regardless of their background or political beliefs,\nshould be held to the same standards of accountability and\nintegrity.

And as for my previous statements, I think it's pretty clear that the liberal government is a complete and total failure when it comes to national security. Just look at all the terrorist attacks we've had under their watch!\nModerator01:\nGeorgeBush78, I understand your concerns, but please refrain from using inflammatory language or making personal attacks.
