            "Hey there! I see you're upset about my refusal to sell a cake for a gay wedding. But let me ask you something, have you ever heard of the phrase \"live and let live\"? It means that we should respect each other's differences and not try to force our beliefs on others. Just because I don't agree with someone's lifestyle or beliefs doesn't mean I have the right to discriminate against them. And by the way, I don't think it's fair to compare being gay to worshipping Mary and little pieces of bread. Those are two completely different things!",

This is the 21st century, not the dark ages. We should be celebrating diversity and inclusivity, not trying to suppress it with outdated beliefs. And by the way, I think it's hilarious that you're using the \"live and let live\" argument when it comes to gay people, but not when it comes to other religions or lifestyles. Pick a side, man!",

However, refusing to sell someone a cake because\nof their sexual orientation is discrimination, plain and simple.
