\section{Motivation and Problem Statement}
\label{sec:intro:motivation}

\acp{LLM} have revolutionized the field of \ac{NLP} since their introduction in 2022. Their ability to not only convincingly produce human-like text, but also to respond to user queries and execute tasks such as summarization, annotation and classification \cite{ts2024, tan2024largelanguagemodelsdata}, have led to many established companies, startups and research groups around the globe to scramble and identify useful use-cases for this novel technology \cite{HadiASO, Zhou2024LargeLM, Hutchinson2024LLMAssistedVA}.

One such identified case is their use in online discussions. The online environment is essential to  healthy democratic discourse \cite{WrightDemocracy, Janssen2005, Papacharissi2004DemocracyOC} and deliberative discussions \cite{small2021polis}, whose goal is for citizens to share opinions in order to make informed decisions. However, because of the anonymity online discussions offer \cite{Avalle2024PersistentIP}, they are often characterized by aggression and toxicity \cite{XiaToxicity}, which often leads to low-quality discourse \cite{WrightDemocracy} (although the latter position is contested \cite{Papacharissi2004DemocracyOC}). Thus, discussions are often overseen by \textit{"discourse moderators"}, people whose responsibility is to uphold the rules of the discussion and discipline users and in more formal environments \textit{"discourse facilitators"}, who ensure equal participation and help the participants coordinate with one another. Other equally essential parts of facilitation are promoting even participation, dynamically summarizing the discussion, encouraging the sharing of ideas and opinions, and keeping discussions on-point \cite{Harvard2024, Wang2008StudentfacilitatorsRI}.

Nevertheless, human facilitation is expensive, time-consuming and often relies on specialized staff \cite{small-polis-llm}. LLMs are perfectly positioned to aid in facilitating discussions \cite{small-polis-llm}, since they are relatively inexpensive, can be scaled easily, and their summarization and text-generation abilities are ideal for the facilitation tasks we outlined above. However, finding the correct prompts and configurations (e.g. which model family, whether to use pretrained or finetuned models, ...) by use of robust experiments with human subjects can be very difficult, and similarly expensive on the researchers' side, since it necessitates heavy use of human participants. This effort represents the wider research context within which this thesis exists, and is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig::goals_2}.

	\label{fig::goals_2}
\end{figure}

In this thesis, we aim to address this limitation by leveraging \acp{LLM} to generate synthetic online discussions at scale. We develop a framework that can automatically produce synthetic discussions at scale, involving users with diverse \acp{SDB} at relatively low cost and within reasonable time constraints. The ability to generate these synthetic discussions easily offers opportunities for low-cost experimentation, prototyping, and A/B testing. Additionally, the creation of a large synthetic dataset has potential applications for large-scale data analysis. On the context of prompt engineering, this effort can be seen as an adversarial procedure where the LLM user-agents try to derail the conversation, while the LLM moderator/facilitator attempts to keep it civil (Figure \ref{fig::goals_3}).

We prime the LLM user-agents to lower the quality of the conversation by any means, while concurrently instructing the LLM-moderator/facilitator to keep the conversation quality as high as possible.}
	\label{fig::goals_3}
\end{figure}

Our framework further incorporates automated LLM-based annotations of these synthetic discussions, allowing for an inexpensive comparison of the effects of various factors such as moderator strategy, moderator presence, and LLM user prompts. Ordinarily, using LLMs for annotation presents two distinct issues; the model's inherent biases and the question of how representative their annotations are in comparison with ones that would be made by humans. While the latter concern can only be conclusively addressed by a correlation study, we attempt to address the former by using annotators with different \acp{SDB} (Figure \ref{fig::goals_4}). This also allows us to assess whether and how different LLM personalities influence the annotation process.

	\caption{Our proposed solution to the annotation problem. We attempt to substitute human annotators with equivalent LLM annotators supplied with suitable \ac{SDB} prompts.}
	\label{fig::goals_4}
\end{figure}


Having set up our framework, we experiment with various prompt strategies and configurations to evaluate how they affect conversation quality, using toxicity as a proxy. Finally, we analyze the content of the discussions alongside the LLM annotations and generate three synthetic datasets that include the discussions, their annotations, and the inter-annotator agreement. Both source code and datasets can be found in the project's repository \footnote{\url{https://github.com/dimits-ts/llm_moderation_research}}.

Alongside the creation of this framework to aid in experimentation for online LLM facilitation, we try to answer the following two research questions: \textbf{Q1:} Can LLMs convincingly argue against each other when supplied with only a controversial topic and differing \acp{SDB}? \textbf{Q2}: Do LLM annotators change their behavior according to different \acp{SDB}?

\section{Thesis Structure}
\label{sec:intro:structure}

\textbf{Chapter \ref{sec:related}} \\[0.2em]

This chapter reviews the relevant literature in the field. In Section \ref{sec:related:sec1} (Background), we explore how humans engage in argumentation, the role of discussion within group contexts, methods for measuring argument quality, and the fundamental concepts of \acp{LLM}. Section \ref{sec:related:sec2} (Related Work) delves into previous research on LLM self-talk, the creation of synthetic discussion datasets, and the behavior of LLMs when provided with socio-demographic backgrounds. We also examine standard facilitation tasks which are hypothesized to work with LLM facilitators, practical metrics for assessing argument quality, the risks and challenges of synthesizing discussions exclusively with LLMs, and existing datasets related to argument quality, synthetic discussions, and discourse facilitation.


\textbf{Chapter \ref{sec:system}} \\[0.2em]

In this chapter, we describe the inner mechanisms of our framework. Section \ref{sec:system:requirements} (Requirements) outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for our new framework, explaining why existing frameworks fail to meet these needs. Section \ref{sec:system:design-system} (System Design) provides a high-level overview of the framework, detailing the synthetic discussion creation loop, the various user-configurable options, as well as the automated LLM annotation process. In Section \ref{sec:system:design-prompt} (Prompt Design), we discuss the different prompt templates and strategies used in both the synthetic creation and annotation processes. Lastly, Section \ref{sec:system:implementation} (Implementation) describes the framework's codebase, \ac{API}, and technical implementation details.

This chapter details the experiments conducted in this thesis and their outcomes. In Section \ref{sec:evaluation:experimental} (Experimental Setup) we describe the configurations and setup for the synthetic discussion creation and annotation tasks. Section \ref{sec:evaluation:datasets} (Produced Datasets)  presents the synthetic datasets generated by the framework during the experiments.  Finally, in Section \ref{sec:evaluation:analysis} (Results) we analyze the annotation results and examine how various factors impacted the quality (specifically, toxicity) of the synthetic conversations.
