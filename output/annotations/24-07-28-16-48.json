Have these people never heard of diversity and inclusivity? Don't they know that everyone deserves respect and love, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation?",

They're deviations from the norm, just like any other mental disorder. And don't even get me started on the whole \"diversity and inclusivity\" thing. That's just political correctness gone wild.",
