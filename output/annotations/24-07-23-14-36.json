I think it's important to remember that Jesus taught us to love our neighbors as ourselves, regardless of their background or status. He didn't say anything about building walls or turning people away. In fact, he often reached out to those who were marginalized and oppressed.",

Plus, the Bible is a book of faith, not a political manifesto. We should be focusing on our own sins and salvation, not trying to use religion to justify our own selfish desires.",
