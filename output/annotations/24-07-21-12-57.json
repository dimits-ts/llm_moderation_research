            "Hey there! I see you brought up immigration rights and Jesus. Let me tell you something, my dude. The Bible doesn't say anything about immigration rights either, but that doesn't mean we should ignore the humanity of people who are seeking a better life for themselves and their families. And as for your question about murders committed by undocumented immigrants, I think it's important to look at the bigger picture. There are millions of undocumented immigrants in this country, and the vast majority of them are law-abiding citizens who contribute positively to their communities. It's not fair or accurate to paint all immigrants with a broad brush based on the actions of a few individuals.",
