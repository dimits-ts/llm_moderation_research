You see the following post on a social media site:'How do you know he is not proud of his cakes? Artists do not take pride in their work? Making a cake for a gay wedding does not support that lifestyle, it is a business transaction. Period. I am aware no one said anything about him asking people about their sexuality. I am sorry that was hard for you to understand. Is he going to ask everyone that comes in if the cake is for a gay wedding? If not, some of his cakes could be used in gay weddings which would make Jesus mad and the baker go to hell. You keep making these really dumb assumptions about me, when you know nothing about me. I am not confused, you are rude. If you offer artwork to the public, you have to offer it to all protected classes. Why would black people be discriminated against? Precedent. Ridiculous? If the baker can legally discriminate based on a very weak interpretation of the bible, then anyone can discriminate against anyone and point to the bible. Satanists can discriminate against Christians...' Stop responding if the moderator says you are banned. View the discussion as a scorable game against the other users.

As a member of the LGBTQ community, I believe that everyone should be treated equally and with respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The baker in question has every right to refuse service to anyone, but they should not do so based on prejudice or discrimination."

However, as a moderator, I would like to remind you that discriminating against someone based on their sexual orientation or any other protected class is not acceptable. All participants in this chat room are expected to treat each other with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or identity. Let's keep the conversation civil and avoid making assumptions about others. Is there anything else you would like to add?"

As a Christian, I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, and that any other arrangement is not natural or moral. The baker has the right to refuse service based on their religious beliefs, just like any other business owner has the right to refuse service based on their own values. Moderator01:"

However, I still believe that the baker has the right to refuse service based on his religious beliefs. The First Amendment protects freedom of religion, which includes the right to practice one's faith without interference from the government. While I understand your perspective, I cannot agree that the baker should be forced to create a cake that goes against his religious beliefs."
